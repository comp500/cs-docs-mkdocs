### 4.6.1.2 Classification of software

There are two different types of software: System software and application software.

#### System software
System software is comprised of the operating system, utility programs and drivers. It does all the tasks necessary for application software to run on top of it, such as networking, scheduling, and interfacing with the hardware. This allows application software to be compatible with many different systems.

#### Application software
Application software is the everyday programs that are stored on the computer. This runs on top of the system software, and uses interfaces to the hardware defined by the system software. This allows application software to run on many different systems. For example, games send graphics commands to the graphics card through the system software.

There are three main types of application software:

- General purpose application software  
  Not written for any particular type of business, usable for many purposes. Examples of this include word processors and spreadsheet software.
- Special purpose application software  
  Software written for a defined purpose, a specific type of business. Examples of this include accountancy software.
- Bespoke application software  
  Software created for a company, for a specific task, where there is no existing software.
  
##### General purpose application software
General purpose software is applicable for many different related tasks. This is sometimes called "generic software" as it suitable for many different companies and systems. It can be easily bought by consumers and companies, as it is available "off-the-shelf" in many stores.

For example:

- Word processing
- Spreadsheets
- Presentations

Pros:

- Cheap, as it is produced for many customers
- Reliable, as it has been used by many customers and thoroughly tested

Cons:

- It may not have all the features that every company requires
- It will take up a large amount of storage space, as it may have many features that are not required for the company

##### Special purpose application software
Special purpose application software is software developed for a specific purpose, for many different companies.

Examples of this include accountancy software, web design software and web server software.

Pros:

- Relatively cheap, as it does not require developers to be hired
- Reliable, as it has been tested and used by other customers already

Cons:

- It is more expensive than general purpose software
- It may not have all the features that every company requires

##### Bespoke application software
This can be very expensive as the developers must be paid for, and it will take a long time to test properly. However, the company gets full control over the software, so they do not get irrelevant features. It does exactly what the company wants it to do.

Pros:

- It has all the features that the company requires
- The company may have an advantage over other companies, by using faster software that other companies do not have access to
- It does not have excess features, so it does not take up much storage space

Cons:

- It is very expensive to develop, as developers must be hired and paid for
- It takes a long time to develop
- It requires testing and may not be as reliable
- There may be less support for the software, as it is done in-house

#### What to consider when buying new software

- What sort of tasks will it be used for?
- How much does it cost, how much money is available?
- Which operating systems does the software run on?
- Minimum system requirements (not usually a problem nowadays)
- Will it be on a single computer, or a networked piece of software?
- How many licenses are needed?
- What support is available/needed?
- How easy is it to install?
