# 4.8.1 Individual (moral), social (ethical), legal and cultural issues and opportunities

## Lesson Notes

### Data Protection Act
Introduced in 1984, this act was created due to public concern about the misuse of personal data in computers. Over the years, it has been updated to reflect newer changes to computing and how data is used.

This act requires that companies who store and process data must register with the [ICO](https://ico.org.uk/) (Information Commissioner's Office). They must state their reasons for storing and processing data, and ensures 8 principles:

1. Data must be processed fairly and lawfully
2. Data must only be used for the specific purpose(s) for which it was collected
3. Data must be adequate, relevant and not excessive for the purpose for which it is processed
4. Data must be kept up to date and accurate
5. Personal information must not be kept for longer than is needed
6. Individuals have the right to access of the data held about them
7. Data must be stored and transferred securely
8. Personal information must not be sent out of the EEA (European Economic Area) unless adequate data protection is in place

### Freedom of Information Act
The Freedom of Information Act enforces transparency in public organisations, by allowing data subjects to access personal and non-personal information held by these organisations. This is done usually through websites and email communications to request data from public and governmental agencies. This act and the Data Protection Act is overseen by the Information Commissioner.

### Computer Misuse Act
The Computer Misuse Act was introduced in 1990 to combat new legal issues faced by the development of computers and telecommunications devices. It was found, in a 1988 court case, that there were no laws existing that prevented the misuse of computers, so one was created.

There are three main offences for computer usage:

- Unauthorised access to computer systems or data
- Unauthorised access with intent to commit further offences
- Unauthorised modification of computer material

Widespread usage of the Internet came mostly after this act was introduced, which meant that this act became significantly harder to enforce. This is due to the ability of hackers to be far away from their target, and even in other countries with different (often relaxed) laws about computer usage.

### Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act
The RIP Act was introduced in 2000 to regulate and state the powers that government agencies have with regards to investigation of crime. This act is a general act covering many areas, but was introduced due to changes in telecommunications and the internet.

This act gives certain government agencies rights to intercept and decrypt data when there is suspicion of criminal activity. Decryption rights also include forcing the person who encrypted data to tell the authorities how to decrypt it.  It also allows employers and schools to monitor computer activity, however this power is more limited compared to government agencies.

### Copyright, Designs and Patents Act
The Copyright, Designs and Patents Act was introduced in 1988 to protect the creators of original works, such as books, music, films and computer software. This Act attempts to reduce copying and stealing of content, so that creators of content can afford to continue creating content.

### Code of Conduct
This is not actual legislation, but it is guidelines set by a company regarding the actions of employees. This is not legally enforceable, but could have consequences for employees who disregard it. Breaches of the code could result in dismissal of employees or exclusion of students.

One example of a code of conduct is for the BCS (British Computer Society), which is a condition of membership to the society; however it covers more issues than just those regarding the society itself. It sets out general rules for use of computers and the internet, so it is often used by other companies and organisations.
